######UPDATE BY LUKE83######
Hellrazors excellent drones have been conscripted to help fill a hole in our current tech-tree, i expect we will eventually modify several ofhis files to better suit the time period of this war but for now they will be added as is ( with only minor changes made to reflect our techtree). 

 Thankyou Reaver for allowing this use, i personally am not a fan of just grabbing other peoples work and dumping it into my own without many changes but alas, time is agaisnt us and his little drone is too good not to use :)

OpenXcom Support Drones Mod v 1.0 by hellrazor

This mod adds a army of small drones towards the xcom arsenal. 
The drones are small 1x1 sized tanks, which are mainly used for scouting and in support roles.
They do have a weak smoke launcher, with limited range and shots, to break enemy line of sight 
or hide exposed soldiers.

There are also models equipped with motion scanners, medikits and tasers for stunning.
The 4 drones are:

	- Drone/Scout (More Armor, buyable)
	- Drone/Scanner (Less Armor, Motion Scanner)
	- Drone/Medikit (Less Armor, Medikit)
	- Drone/Taser (Less Armor, Taser for range limited stun)

There is also a enhanced Alien Alloy Version of each of them, which are a little bit faster and way more durable.
Each drone does use one of the HWP spots in your craft, allowing you, to bring a bigger team of soldiers
and still have a sacrifical/expandable unit nearby. Of course you can also mix them with normal tanks.
For example a vanilla Avenger could carry, two normal tanks, two drones and also 16 soldiers, which is a decent sized fighting force.

Feel free to experiment with the usage of drones, their main strong point is the small hitbox they have.
They are usually optimal for scout and sniper tactics.
