  STR_FUSION_BALL_UFOPEDIA: "THIS LAUNCHER FIRES A BALL SHAPED MISSILE POWERED BY ANTI-MATTER REACTION. THE BALL DESTROYS THE TARGET WITH A GRAVITY WAVE IMPLOSION."
  STR_LASER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "THIS CONVENTIONAL LASER BEAM IS POWERED BY AN ANTI-MATTER REACTION CHAMBER."
  STR_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: "THE GRAVITY BEAM DIRECTS A FINELY CHANNELLED IMPLODING GRAVITY FIELD."
  STR_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: "The Sectoid hierarchy ranges from soldiers to leaders with powerful psionic abilities. These psionic powers can be used to demoralise soldiers in combat, or even take control of their minds. They tend to indulge in human abductions and cattle mutilation. The abduction is used to extract genetic material for cross breeding and developing clones for infiltrating human society. The cattle provide both nutrition and genetic material. This race appears to want to develop superior genetic hybrids to increase the efficiency of their hive-like society."
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY: "Sectoid autopsy"
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The autopsy reveals vestigial digestive organs and a simple structure. The brain and eyes are very well developed. The structure suggests genetic alteration or mutation. The small mouth and nose appear to have little function. The webbing between the fingers, and the flat feet suggest aquatic origins. There are no reproductive organs, and no clues as to how this species can reproduce. They are most probably a genetically engineered species."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This race developed in an extremely hostile environment. They are extremely tough and can resist extreme temperature variations. Their mobility depends on a snake-like giant 'foot' which protects all the vital organs. Their objectives appear to be purely predatory and they appear to be under the command of some other intelligence which directs their military-style incursions on earth."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY: "Snakeman autopsy"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The skin is extremely tough and heat resistant. The cardio-vascular system is part of the muscular system which uses the hydraulic principle to create motion. The only true muscle is the 'heart'. The reproductive system appears to be very efficient. Reproduction is asexual, with each snakeman carrying up to fifty eggs inside its body at any one time. Left to its own devices this species would be a severe threat to life on earth."
  STR_ETHEREAL_UFOPEDIA: "This being has awesome mental powers which allow for telepathic communication and telekinetic abilities. The apparently weak physical abilities of this creature are sustained by its mental powers. We do not understand how these telekinetic powers work, since they seem to defy the laws of physics as we know them. They are extremely dangerous in any combat situation, where they rely on their mental powers for combat. They rarely appear on earth since they seem to rely on other races to pursue their objectives."
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY: "Ethereal autopsy"
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This being is physically retarded and seems incapable of sustaining any life functions. The muscles are severely atrophied and the internal organs appear to be under-developed. The sensory organs, including the eyes, do not appear to function at all. The brain, however, is well developed and draws on a high proportion of the body's blood supply. It is a mystery as to how this creature can sustain itself without external support."
  STR_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: "This humanoid creature is physically powerful and intelligent. They have a particular appetite for consuming raw flesh of any kind, which they need for sustenance like earth based carnivores. They appear to rely on telepathic commands from a race known as 'Ethereals'. Once separated from this telepathic link their mental system appears to break down and they die. The cybernetic implants are used to enhance their combat performance. They are clearly the foot soldiers for a higher intelligence."
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY: "Muton autopsy"
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The 'skin' of this creature appears to be an organically created protective armour which is grafted onto the body. There are numerous cybernetic implants which are used to enhance the cardio-vascular system and the senses. The reproductive organs appear to have been surgically removed. Evidently these unfortunate creatures are limited to a life of warfare and conquest. Armour piercing ammunition is not very effective against their toughened skin."
  STR_CELATID_UFOPEDIA: "This life-form has the mysterious natural ability to float through the air. It appears to detect human brain waves and will move towards a human target even if well hidden. Once a target is detected the Celatid lands and fires small globules of extremely corrosive venom. The creature has the ability to clone itself at an alarming rate. It accompanies the Muton race in its wanderings."
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY: "Celatid autopsy"
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The core contains a small bio-mechanical device which appears to be a naturally evolved anti-gravity propulsion system. The sac of venom is the largest organ and there does not appear to be a separate brain structure. There is no discernible digestive or reproductive system. A small organ contains embryos which can grow rapidly into a new being."
  STR_SILACOID_UFOPEDIA: "This silicon based life form generates an enormous amount of heat. It has the strength to crush rocks which can then be ingested by the hot core. It has a primitive intelligence and can be controlled by implants or telepathic beings. It works with the Muton alien race."
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY: "Silacoid autopsy"
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The core of the creature is extremely hot, and seems to be the basis for a digestive system. Its unique muscle system has tremendous power and speed. Its rock-like skin is not harmed by fire or incendiary ammunition."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA: "The crab-like claws of this creature are a powerful weapon in close combat. The high metabolism and strength of this creature give it speed and dexterity. Instead of killing its victim it impregnates it with an egg and injects a venom which turns it into a walking zombie. A new Chryssalid will burst from the victim shortly after impregnation. Chryssalids are associated with the Snakeman race."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY: "Chryssalid autopsy"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The exoskeleton of this creature is extremely tough, but surprisingly vulnerable to explosive ammunition. The brain is well developed, and its cell growth rate very fast. The creature carries twenty eggs which are laid inside other organisms. This creature is a very effective terror weapon."
  STR_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "The Floaters are primarily soldiers and terror agents. They are naturally predatory beasts, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced to make formidable warriors. The lower half of the body and most internal organs are surgically removed, and a life support system is installed. This implant contains an anti-gravity unit which enables the creature to float, albeit unsteadily, through the air."
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY: "Floater autopsy"
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature has been drastically altered by surgery. The device which seems to form the core of the body is a life support system, taking over the function of heart, lungs and digestive system. This would enable the creature to survive in extremely hostile environments. The brain is smaller than ours, but the sensory organs are well developed."
  STR_REAPER_UFOPEDIA: "This bipedal carnivore has powerful jaws and a voracious appetite. It has a number of brain implants which are used to control its activity. The primitive predatory instincts of this creature are of little use except to terrorise and destroy. Reapers are commonly associated with Floaters."
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY: "Reaper autopsy"
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Reaper contains two 'brains' and two 'hearts' which allow it to function even when heavily wounded. However, its furry skin is highly flammable, making the creature vulnerable to incendiary weapons."
  STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectopods are robot creatures with a powerful laser beam weapon. The control of these mechanical beasts is via a telepathic link to their controllers, the Ethereals. Sectopods are the most powerful terror weapon available to the alien forces."
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY: "Sectopod autopsy"
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The robot is sturdily constructed with powered armour capable of resisting most forms of attack, in particular plasma weapons. However, the sensing circuitry seems particularly vulnerable to laser weapons."
  STR_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature flying saucer is an automated terror weapon armed with a powerful plasma beam. The anti-gravity propulsion gives it a big advantage in difficult terrain. Its primary function is destruction and terror in the service of the Sectoid race."
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY: "Cyberdisc autopsy"
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Cyberdisc is well shielded and is particularly good at withstanding explosive ammunition. The primary anti-gravity system is too badly damaged to gain any understanding of its functioning."
  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The power source of alien craft is an anti-matter reactor which uses Elerium (element 115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy. The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Elerium can produce a huge amount of power. This unit can be reproduced easily using alien alloys."
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft use sophisticated computers to navigate on earth and through space. The system is based on optical processors arranged in network fashion. The control interface is relatively simple - the navigator controls the direction of gravity waves generated by the power source to move the craft in any direction. This system can be used easily by humans, and it can be reproduced using alien alloys and other components."
  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft consist of three main components - a power source, a navigation system and a hull built from alien alloys. The hull is specially designed to allow gravity waves to be directed and controlled. In addition a small quantity of Elerium is required to fuel the power source. Once the principles of construction are understood, and the functions of each component are known, then it is possible to build these types of craft."
  STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: "These chambers contain various enzymes which are used to digest the body parts of cattle, other animals and even humans. The liquid is then consumed as ready digested food - probably direct to the bloodstream. This suggests a certain dependence on earth for food - a symbiosis between earth and alien society."
  STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "These chambers contain alien foetuses. The design of these containers seems to suggest that the aliens which use this process rely completely on laboratory reproduction. The rich nutrients ensure rapid development of the foetus. This factory line system could generate thousands of alien clones in a short space of time. The process could be easily adapted for human reproduction, or alien-human hybrids."
  STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The most likely function of these spheres is recreational. The psionic circuitry stimulates various centres of the brain. The effect is similar to hallucinogenic drugs. This is the only evidence that aliens have any cultural or recreational pastimes."
  STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: "This surgical equipment uses laser cutters to extract certain body parts from cattle and other animals. The widespread cattle mutilations can be accounted for by this bizarre alien activity. It is likely that these parts are used for nutritional or genetic purposes."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "In the past many thousands of people have claimed to have been abducted by aliens, sometimes repeatedly. The truth is far more horrific. Humans are abducted, researched and monitored. The best specimens have genetic material extracted. Women have human-alien hybrid foetuses implanted, and then removed several months later. Who knows what sinister motives the aliens have?"
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft are constructed from special alloys with unique properties. They are extremely light and durable, and can be moulded by electro-magnetic methods. This material can be reproduced and used in many kinds of manufacturing processes."
  STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "This element has the unusual property of generating anti-matter power when bombarded with certain particles. This creates gravity waves and other forms of energy. It is not naturally found in our solar system and cannot be reproduced."
  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that we are fighting a losing battle on earth. The alien hordes are overwhelming in number. The best we can do is slow down their progress. The only hope for humanity is to tackle the aliens at their source. Our research seems to indicate a nearby base of operations within our solar system. Aliens indicate this place to be the centre of an ancient civilisation that pre-dates human history. We must locate this place as soon as possible. However, we need to capture and interrogate an alien leader to gain more detailed information. The larger UFOs probably contain at least one alien leader."
  STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our research now points to Mars as the base of alien operations. The base is well hidden, and contains all the manufacturing and cloning facilities to fuel the infiltration of earth. It also seems to contain a controlling computer of some kind that controls the whole operation. It seems that the hive-like alien society has some kind of 'queen bee'. This is their fundamental weakness - if we can eliminate the 'brain' then the body will die. We must step up our research efforts before it is too late. In order to progress we must capture the highest ranking aliens - the commanders - which only reside in alien bases and battleships."
  STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA: "It is now clear that the alien hordes are being controlled from an underground base in Cydonia - which is an unusual area of Mars featuring five sided pyramids and a large formation resembling a human face. Cydonian civilisation once flourished on Mars many millions of years ago, but we do not know why it died out, or what the connection is with the latest alien activity there. Whatever the explanation we must send an expedition to Cydonia. This is the only way that we can defeat the aliens. We must destroy the controlling master 'brain'. We will need an Avenger craft equipped with the most awesome destructive power at our disposal. There is nothing more we can learn here - we must await the outcome of the Cydonian assault."

  STR_VICTORY_2: "The brain speaks: 'Many millions of years ago the planet you call Mars was alive. This life was brought to a barren planet by our civilisation as it was to yours. For millions of years we have visited your planet and genetically developed your species. You cannot kill us, you are part of us..."
  STR_VICTORY_3: "Here is the centre of Martian civilisation - the pyramids built millions of years before yours - by a species which is your ancestor. No planet is beyond our reach. This power could be yours before long. All we ask is your co-operation..."
  STR_GAME_OVER_1: "The aliens attempt to exterminate all humanity, destroying cities and poisoning the air and sea. The resistance of earth armies is futile in the face of vastly superior technology. Surviving generations suffer terrible mutations as they flee alien destruction. They are rounded up into slave camps to help transform earth into an alien colony which is part of some unknown empire."

The combination of high fire power and strong armour makes these units valuable for open terrain fire fights. Make sure that there are sufficient cannon shells in your stores to re-arm tanks. They are armed automatically when you assign them to a squad."
  STR_TANK_ROCKET_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This automated Heavy Weapons Platform is armed with powerful rockets. This will be devastating for any alien foe. Make sure your stores are kept supplied with HWP rockets."
  STR_TANK_LASER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Laser weapons are a useful addition for HWPs. It combines heavy firepower with no ammunition restrictions."
  STR_HOVERTANK_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "Alien technology has given the HWP a new lease of life. The added manoeuvrability of air travel and the power of plasma beams is a lethal combination."
  STR_HOVERTANK_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This hovertank has a fusion ball launcher that is capable of immense devastation. Use it with great care. You will have to manufacture the fusion balls to keep these HWPs fully armed. A fusion ball is an intelligent guided weapon. In order to fire it you select a number of 'way points' with the cursor and then click on the launch icon to fire the fusion ball."
  STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device is used as ammunition for a Heavy Plasma Gun. It contains a small quantity of Elerium."
  STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This small object is used as a power source for a Plasma Rifle - a medium powered alien weapon. Contains a small quantity of Elerium."
  STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "Power source for the small alien Plasma Pistol. Contains Elerium - the source of all alien power."
  STR_STUN_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "The Stun Bomb is used for capturing live human specimens, but it can also be used against most alien races. It is fired from a Small Launcher."
  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The alien research mission is used for collecting basic data on earth and its inhabitants. Small vehicles are predominantly used, with occasional landings in deserted areas. This type of alien activity poses the least threat to RE/SYST, with little concern from governments or the public."
  STR_ALIEN_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have many uses for earth's fauna. Animals are abducted secretly, and returned with various organs removed. Cattle mutilations are predominantly reported along with UFO sightings. This type of alien activity causes great concern for governments and considerable anxiety amongst the population. This type of activity occurs mainly in farming land. The theory behind the 'alien harvest' suggests that alien races originally 'seeded' the planet with its flora and fauna, and now they have returned to reap the harvest they have sown."
  STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "This is the most insidious form of alien activity. The abduction by aliens is widely reported, despite the aliens' attempts to erase the experience from their victims' memories. Abductees report being subject to humiliating physical examinations, including impregnation of alien foetuses and bizarre genetic experiments. The purpose behind this activity appears to be linked to genetic mutation and manipulation of the aliens' own genetic material. This activity causes great alarm, and occurs in populated areas or cities"
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Earth governments can be infiltrated by alien agents which are human in appearance. This can result in official contact between aliens and governments at the highest level. The climax of this activity is characterised by intense UFO activity in the vicinity of major cities. The aliens will attempt to sign a pact with an earth government by offering knowledge of their superior technology. In return the government will allow the aliens to conduct their activity unhindered. This alien mission represents the worst threat to RE/SYST. If a government agrees to a pact then its funding will cease."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens will construct secret underground bases in remote locations. After some initial reconnaissance flights some intense UFO activity will occur as the base is being built. These bases are known to contain experimental labs for human abductees, and supplies for further activity in the region. The presence of alien bases will generate a large amount of reported alien activity without the presence of UFOs. In order to locate a base an RE/SYST craft must patrol an area for a few hours to stand some chance of detection."
  STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA: "When the aliens terrorise a city they will deploy some special forces with awesome powers. Civilians will be directly threatened, and governments will be forced to evacuate whole areas. The main purpose behind this activity is to generate sufficient public hysteria so that governments will threaten the RE/SYST project."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If RE/SYST interceptors are being particularly successful in shooting down UFOs then the aliens may take some retaliatory action. This could result in a direct attack against an RE/SYST base. However, the aliens have to find an RE/SYST base in order to attack it, and provided UFOs are kept away then there should be little danger of an assault."
  STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once an alien base is constructed then it is resupplied on a regular basis by a special supply vessel. If one of these vessels is detected while landing then it is certain that an alien base is nearby."
  STR_SMALL_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "This tiny craft is primarily used for reconnaissance or research. It normally precedes larger vessels at the start of an alien mission."

  STR_ABDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This vessel is equipped with an examination room for performing horrific experiments on human subjects. The victim is normally paralysed by telepathic powers, but remains conscious while on the operating table."
  STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The terror ship has a containment facility for large alien terror weapons or creatures. It is used to transport these alien terrorists into populated areas."
  STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The battleship is the largest and most powerful alien craft. It is normally the primary alien mission craft, equipped with powerful weapons and numerous crew members."

  STR_PWT_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "THE PULSE WAVE TORPEDO UTILIZES A SUPERHEATED FUEL SYSTEM AND AN EXTREMELY DENSE WARHEAD WHICH CAN PUNCH THROUGH MOST ALLOYS."
  STR_GAUSS_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "THE GAUSS WEAPON IS NEWLY DEVELOPED RE/SYST TECHNOLOGY. THIS SYSTEM'S PARTICLE ACCELERATOR IS POWERED BY A COMPACT, LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED, FUSION REACTOR."
  STR_SONIC_OSCILLATOR_UFOPEDIA: "A POWERFUL AUDITORY OSCILLATOR CREATES WAVES OF SONIC FORCE. DESTROYING THE TARGET BY VIBRATING ITS MOLECULAR BONDS APART."
  STR_AQUATOID_UFOPEDIA: "The Aquatoid Race is an ancient society, having existed millennia before man's first faltering steps upon the world. Their compact form and bulbous features are a throwback to their space faring brethren, the Sectoids. Their power is based on the powerful Molecular Control technology. The Aquatoid race seeks to propagate its sterile race by genetic modification, the ideal subjects being human beings. Experiments have spawned numerous hybrid races."
  STR_AQUATOID_AUTOPSY: "Aquatoid autopsy"
  STR_AQUATOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A detailed analysis of this creature allows us to make some basic assumptions. It is a Sectoid, our former foes, but changed by surgical methods and implants to be an aquatic creature. Vestigial lungs allow the breathing of air and limited surface mobility. There are cybernetic implants throughout the body, enhancing the strength of its atrophied limbs and the function of its organs. As all the members of this race are identical, we may hypothesize that these creatures are clones."
  STR_GILLMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Almost human, a strange creature who appears to be a reptilian humanoid, very closely related to man. This creature is extremely powerful and fast in the undersea world. Gillmen are a fully fledged race, there being male and female specimens of varying ages. They are unlike the majority of the underwater aliens as they bear none of the signs of genetic alteration or surgical deformation. It is possible we are looking at some ancient branch of our own species."
  STR_GILLMAN_AUTOPSY: "Gillman autopsy"
  STR_GILLMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once surgery began it became clear this is no alien, but an Earth born creature, an ancient pre-historic race that was thought destroyed at the very moment mammals became dominant. In a time when dinosaurs roamed these creatures lived, the Gillmen- amphibious, intelligent and strong. The cataclysm that ended the reptile rule on this planet forced these creatures into a symbiotic relationship with the newly arrived aliens. A small electronic device is lodged in the skulls of the creatures."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This is a staggering creature, taller than a man and boasting six limbs, it resembles nothing more than an aquatic Demon. The similarities between this creature and the Earth lobster have earned it the nickname of Lobsterman with the RE/SYST troops. This is a behemoth of the deep. A carefully designed fighting creature of incredible strength and practically invulnerable to missile fire. Its pincers alone can crush steel."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_AUTOPSY: "Lobsterman autopsy"
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once past its virtually indestructible shell the creature is an amazing construction. Powerful muscles ripple around a titanium skeleton, a sophisticated targeting system with multi-band scanning ability is hooked directly into the creature's brain. Its multiple eyes are protected by harder than steel plastics and it is clear that when well deployed by their masters these creatures are all but unstoppable. Buried deep within its body are devices of unknown construction and function."
  STR_TASOTH_UFOPEDIA: "These agile and fast enemies are a mainstay of the alien army. Hundreds are birthed, in massive breeding vats deep in the heart of the Alien colonies. Vastly more powerful than a man, the Tasoth is a true alien and its behaviour and carnivorous nature unmatched on the planet. The Tasoth often forms the spearhead of an alien attack and never seems to shrink from the fight even in the face of overwhelming odds."
  STR_TASOTH_AUTOPSY: "Tasoth autopsy"
  STR_TASOTH_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Dissection revealed a cybernetic organism possessed of strange power. Inside the body cavity is a small power unit, but no identifiable organs. The power is transmitted throughout the body by a Bio-electric transmission system. The whole body lacks bones or any other supporting structure. Once dead the power stops and the creature becomes a lifeless rag doll of oozing alien flesh and fluids. The only other internal construction is a pair of ceramic cells, which if energized briefly revive the creature."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_UFOPEDIA: "The Deep One is a biological nightmare, a cross breed, produced by the mind warping experiments of the Aquatoids. We have encountered several variations of this creature. After extensive research we conclude that these are manufactured by the invaders. Swelling their ranks when fresh human stock has been captured. Each of these sub-humans is armed with an electrical energy discharge powerful enough to kill an aquanaut."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_AUTOPSY: "Deep One autopsy"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature is a graft of man and alien organism. The human brain is massively altered to accommodate control electronics and the Alien cortex. All vestiges of the human body seem lost save one: the eyes. The surgical graft appears to allow the alien foetus to consume the human host as it grows. The tough skin of the creature appears to be a non-organic, metallic mesh, extremely strong and flexible. The resulting cross breed is strong, fast and utterly under the control of the aliens."
  STR_BIODRONE_UFOPEDIA: "The Bio-drone is a creation only an alien mind could conceive of. It is a brain, (human or alien) suspended in amniotic fluids and connected to a powered base unit that can fly on land or below water. Each Bio-drone is armed with a powerful auditory disruptor, part machine and part organism. Some of our scientists have suggested that the weapon is driven by the host organism's original vocal cords. Highly accurate and tenacious these super guard dogs are widely used by the aliens to protect valuable assets."
  STR_BIODRONE_AUTOPSY: "Bio-drone autopsy"
  STR_BIODRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The hypothesis that the auditory disruptor is a biological device are true. This unfortunate creature literally screams its enemies to death. Every example has massive surgical trauma scars and is severely mutilated. The aliens appear to butcher the brain into obedience. Most of the cortex's used in the creatures are alien in origin, but nothing can compare to the horror of finding a human based unit. The Bio-drones are powered by an ION engine and incorporate some form of remote control system."
  STR_TENTACULAT_UFOPEDIA: "Not even the depths of a Lovecraftian nightmare could spawn such as this indescribable creature. No comparison to any Earth animal exists, the environment that could produce such as this is beyond imagination. Armed with long tentacles the Tentaculat paralyzes its victims then transmutes them into mindless things. These progeny can cause death on touch, even through armour. The Tentaculat is the most fearsome alien yet encountered by RE/SYST."
  STR_TENTACULAT_AUTOPSY: "Tentaculat autopsy"
  STR_TENTACULAT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The autopsy reveals small cybernetic implants are lodged in the creature's large brain. The vision system is a complex combination of visible light and thermal imaging acquisition. Even in the inky depths of the ocean this monster can navigate with unerring accuracy. There are vestigial organs that seem to be the bare minimum for survival. Each creature has a small stomach with an external connector, it is logical to assume the being is fed by direct nutrient input by its masters."
  STR_CALCINITE_UFOPEDIA: "Like the diving suits of lost mariners these aliens stalk the seabed for the unwary. A vicious swipe by the creature's stronger than steel claws can be enough to send the best divers to the bottom. Swirling around in the face mask a gelatinous green form can be seen. No hint of the real creature can be divined from the often lethal encounters we have had with them."
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY: "Calcinite autopsy"
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once the armoured suit is stripped away the Calcinite is revealed to be a huge amorphous blob of protoplasm. No visible brain, limbs or sensory organs exist, a small metallic component resides deep in the liquid body. Once dead we can only guess at the creature's nature. An inexplicable enigma of our alien enemies."
  STR_TRISCENE_UFOPEDIA: "This bipedal reptile is a throwback to the age of the Dinosaurs. It seems to be a Cretaceous creature in every sense save its ability to survive in water and on land. These creatures are slung with weapons pods and have a jaw lined with huge metallic teeth. Often these monsters have been at the core of the alien attack forces as the Aliens launch assaults upon the land. A heavyweight and potent weapon, the Tasoth commanders deploy them with lethal efficiency."
  STR_TRISCENE_AUTOPSY: "Triscene autopsy"
  STR_TRISCENE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once subjected to the scientist's knife the Triscene reveals that it is an ancient creature, supplemented with cybernetic implants and weapons systems. Its tiny brain is supplemented by a small computer module mounted in the control harness all the creatures wear. A tough natural skin, a predatory instinct enhanced by additional weapons makes this a lethal opponent in all environments."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_UFOPEDIA: "Having harvested the oceans the aliens have bred these huge Earth creatures as a weapon. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security when facing these harmless looking sailors of the deeps. Possessed of a close combat icy strike, the Hallucinoid is a deadly foe."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY: "Hallucinoid autopsy"
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Nested in the many layers of the gelatinous body of this organism is a powerful chemical freezer, its' main offensive capability. The soft and supple skin of the Hallucinoid seems susceptible to heat based attacks. Often this mutant is found in the company of its masters, the Aquatoids."
  STR_XARQUID_UFOPEDIA: "Another modified Earth invertebrate, the Xarquid is a creature of great beauty and danger. The swift swimming gargantuan hides a devastating arsenal of weapons, a smothering ink spray and an ionized particle blast. Since our first encounters with this powerful creature we have been wary of its power and its controllers the vengeful Gillmen."
  STR_XARQUID_AUTOPSY: "Xarquid autopsy"
  STR_XARQUID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This overgrown Nautilus has been made huge on a diet of Alien drugs and surgical alterations. Perverted beyond the scope of nature, the Gillmen have added mechanical control systems to the creature and now none of the creature's original nature exists. Deployed as an organic weapons platform, the Xarquids tough shell and mobility make it a formidable opponent."
  STR_ION_BEAM_ACCELERATORS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien flying submarines rely on complex power systems to drive them at incredible speed through the deeps. The basis for their technology is the ION DISPLACER, utilizing Zrbite as a catalyst, the engines displace 100 times their own volume in water per second. This enormous power means that the aliens are capable of outrunning most Earth subs. We can replicate this system of propulsion using aqua-plastics and Zrbite power cells."
  STR_MAGNETIC_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "These units generate a spherical multi-layer magnetic field, which the array projects up to 1000m around the sub. The Alien navigators are directly linked into the machines and feel their way around the invisible world beneath the waves. The interface system operates using Alien modified cerebral matter that communicates directly with the operator's brain via a neural link."
  STR_ALIEN_SUB_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Each vessel has a chameleon-like structure, carefully modelled on sea creatures, and constructed of Aqua Plastics. Each submarine functions as an organism: crew and craft in harmony. Most of these systems can be replicated and a hybrid technology can be evolved to allow us to move up to the same technological level."
  STR_ALIEN_CRYOGENICS_UFOPEDIA: "The innumerable Aliens that have lain hidden on the Earth are held in suspended animation, cryogenically frozen. All the creatures are sealed into units, their body temperature reduced to a point where bodily functions are all but stopped. An examination of the units so far reveals the unbelievable time periods that the bodies have been kept suspended for, some over 60 million years."
  STR_ALIEN_CLONING_UFOPEDIA: "Many of the Aliens we have captured are identical even down to their DNA, duplicates in every way. Cell samples are placed into the units from the frozen gene banks of the Aliens. Some units contain humans or body parts. It is possible that another use for these cloning units is to create some Alien-human hybrid."
  STR_ALIEN_LEARNING_ARRAYS_UFOPEDIA: "Utilizing Molecular Control Implants in the skulls of all Aliens these machines inject information directly into the brain. Freshly cloned Aliens are brought to these units and have racial memories and all scientific or combat information downloaded into their blank minds."
  STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTER_UFOPEDIA: "This unit is used to fit Aliens with Molecular Control Implants, fertilize reproducing races, and insert or remove organs and electronics from any creature. The process was thought to be done on subdued patients, but the subject is very aware of the process and unfortunately human anatomy seems to fit the unit perfectly."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "We now have the evidence to work out why Aliens capture humans. They are not food, they are not fertilized with Alien embryos, rather they form the basis of a range of creatures and control systems. Alien technology is based on a common mind, a shared intellect and the human brain is the ideal receptacle for these systems. Human brain tissue is used in most of the Alien biological computer storage and retrieval systems, the remains are used for building and for breeding."
  STR_AQUA_PLASTICS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien submarines and structures utilize an incredibly strong, flexible and durable material for the majority of their construction. Aqua plastics are complex multi-bonded and Zrbite catalysed materials. Dense, yet light, the substance has strength above even Titanium or Kevlar."
  STR_ZRBITE_UFOPEDIA: "This is an alloy of Alien origin, part gold part Alien Bio-material. When utilized as a power source, small quantities will generate more power than a nuclear unit of 10 times the size. It is beyond our technical ability to replicate this material as most of its constituents are Alien in origin."
  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "The Aliens strike all across the globe, with ruthless efficiency. We cannot pin down their source. Could it be in some ocean deep too impenetrable for us to locate? Not all the organisms we have encountered are Alien, some are very old, some are from evolutionary paths long thought extinct. We are dealing with a menace that has been sleeping for millennia, a subtle symbiosis of human and Alien. Deep in the oceans there lie ancient sites used by the Aliens to contact their stellar cousins. Each of these twelve sites contains a Synomium device, a powerful Alien technology. Now with their war machine on the march the Aliens are re-activating these sites to widen their Molecular Control net, we must destroy these sites at all costs."
  STR_THE_ULTIMATE_THREAT_UFOPEDIA: "Sixty-five million years ago a vast colony ship was sent to the Earth from a distant Alien world. As the enormous craft approached the infant planet a massive and violent solar flare caused a navigation systems failure. Crippled and failing the vast bulk plummeted through the stratosphere to emerge into Cretaceous skies. On the Earth innumerable species of life strained their gazes skywards as their nemesis ploughed into the planet. A vast cloud of dust clogged the atmosphere and as the land cooled so the dominant life, the mighty dinosaurs, perished. But the 400 billion tonnes of T'leth was not destroyed in the impact, sophisticated super computers initiated a cryogenic sleep cycle for the creatures deep in its holds.  As the aeons passed the computers woke parties of Aliens to attempt communication with their stellar cousins, all in vain for the core of the Alien power slept on."
  STR_TLETH_THE_ALIEN_CITY: "T'leth the Alien's City"
  STR_TLETH_THE_ALIEN_CITY_UFOPEDIA: "T'leth the huge Alien colony ship lies embedded in the Sigsbee Deep, in the Gulf of Mexico.  At the Heart of the city is an Alien horror, so vile and so powerful that not even death can claim it. In a chamber of Alien metal lies the sleeping form of the great dreamer, the Ultimate Alien. Raising T'leth above the waves will begin his re-animation cycle, and once risen he will be unstoppable. Although not alive and somehow not dead the Alien mind controls the Alien army. The weird technology of molecular control connects all Aliens to the One mind and the One mind to all the Aliens. Genetically mutated Alien/human foetuses supply the Alien mind with energy and form the link between the ruler and his subjects. The myth of the Ultimate Alien has existed in the hearts and minds of humankind for centuries, the sea has always hidden the ultimate truth."

  STR_BOMBARDMENT_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "The Pressure Bombardment shield protects the base from Alien submersibles docking and sets up a resonating field that repulses attacking subs long enough for defence systems to fire repeatedly. In effect this doubles the effectiveness of any defence systems already deployed."
  STR_MC_GENERATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Since Alien subs utilize Molecular Control Technology to detect the presence of living creatures, using a negative M.C. emitter will blanket a base with an impenetrable shield to confuse the Aliens and disguise our presence."
  STR_MC_LAB_UFOPEDIA: "The Molecular Control lab can implant and train up to ten aquanauts at one time. Implants are surgically installed in the skulls of aquanauts. Extensive training allows them to utilize their implants. Implant skills are used in conjunction with a Molecular Device and can be used for attacks during combat."
  STR_TRANSMISSION_RESOLVER_UFOPEDIA: "Alien communications utilize the Molecular control implant network the Aliens have built up. The transmission resolver facility intercepts Alien Sub transmissions and decodes the information. This will show the type of Alien Sub, the Alien race and the type of activity that is occurring."
  STR_SUB_PEN_UFOPEDIA: "Each Pen can accommodate one submarine. There are facilities for maintenance, refuelling and repair of the RE/SYST submarine fleet. Each Flying Sub stationed at a base must have a free Pen assigned to it which cannot be used by other Subs, even if the assigned submarine is out on a mission."

  STR_HYDRO_JET_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Hydro-Jet Cannons are a heavy infantry weapon system. The cannon fires magnesium fuelled mini-torpedoes. Although powerful, the Hydro-Jet Cannon is a clumsy and unwieldy device, suitable for aquatic use only."
  STR_TORPEDO_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "A real heavyweight, this large launcher fires three types of torpedo, each with its own propulsion unit. A devastating weapon, with only manual loading being its drawback. Ammunition types available include large or small high explosive and phosphor tipped torpedoes, all for submerged use only."

  STR_HEAVY_GAUSS_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy Gauss is cumbersome, but extremely effective. It operates with 3 particle accelerators and is virtually unstoppable. The anti-proton stream is confined inside a Gallium Arsenide shell that implodes on impact releasing the anti-matter."
  STR_MAGNA_BLAST_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This standard issue grenade has an accurate and sophisticated timer for precision control."
  STR_DYE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Dye grenades are dual role items, useful for providing cover in exposed situations. Functioning in both water and land environments the dye is ejected as a particle cloud, producing an octopus like ink spray in water or dense air borne cloud on land."
  STR_PARTICLE_DISTURBANCE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A proximity grenade which can be thrown like an ordinary grenade but is triggered by nearby movement after it is deployed. Skill and training are required to use these devices properly."
  STR_MAGNA_PACK_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "This explosive should only be used for demolition purposes. However past experience has shown that these powerful explosive packs are ideal weapons for rooting out Aliens. The blast radius is large so ensure no aquanauts are within the minimum safe distance."
  STR_PARTICLE_DISTURBANCE_SENSOR_UFOPEDIA: "This new device uses a variety of detectors and advanced computer systems to identify moving enemy units. Click on the Disturbance Sensor icon on the tactical display. Select 'Use Sensor' from the menu. The Sensor display shows an arrow in the centre which is the direction the aquanaut is facing (North is at the top). The blips show units which have moved recently.

  STR_THERMAL_TAZER_UFOPEDIA: "This device can only be used in close combat, but will stun a living organism without killing it by freezing the creature."
  STR_VIBRO_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "The Vibroblade is a long sharp knife blade of titanium which spins at over 6000 rpm, this device can crack even the toughest diving armour. The power source is an Alien invention, our attempt at building these items before met with dismal failure, our blades rotated too slowly or exploded under pressure."
  STR_THERMIC_LANCE_UFOPEDIA: "The Thermic Lance is a logical extension of the Vibroblade technology The blade revolves at high speed and a Zrbite power source superheats the blade to cut armour like a warm knife through butter "
  STR_HEAVY_THERMIC_LANCE_UFOPEDIA: "The Heavy Thermic Lance is a more powerful version of the TL. Twin heat sources and a extremely high rotation speed means that the Heavy Thermic lance is virtually unstoppable against all materials."
  STR_SONIC_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "The Sonic Cannon the most potent of the Sonic weapons family. Featuring a higher range audio oscillator and a larger reverberation chamber than the Blasta. The Cannon also has a pulse detonation system that alters the ultra-sonic wave by modulation to produce a more effective Sonic Shock."
  STR_CANNON_POWER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device is used as ammunition for a Sonic Cannon. It contains a small quantity of Zrbite."
  STR_SONIC_BLASTA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A more powerful Sonic device. Not even high carbon steel is immune to this weapon. The highly compact wave emitter is enhanced by a super conductor amplifier to increase the power of this weapon."
  STR_BLASTA_POWER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This small object is used as a power source for a Sonic Rifle, a potent Alien weapon, and contains a small quantity of Zrbite."
  STR_SONIC_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Sonic pistols are an Alien weapon based on ultra-sonic audio waves that can jellify bone in seconds. The Ultra-Sonic waves occupy a range beyond the scope of human hearing."
  STR_PISTOL_POWER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "Power source for the compact Alien Sonic Pistol. Contains Zrbite - the source of all Alien power."
  STR_DISRUPTOR_PULSE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This is an Alien aquatic use only guided weapon firing self propelled 'Disruptor Projectiles'. When you click to fire the weapon it will generate 'way points' for the Projectile to follow. When you have positioned enough way points click on the launch icon."
  STR_DISRUPTOR_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "This device is a Disruptor Pulse Projectile fitted with an onboard computer guidance system. It is fired from a Disruptor Pulse launcher."
  STR_THERMAL_SHOK_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "A small Thermal Shok launcher which fires chemical freeze bombs. Very useful for capturing live Aliens."
  STR_THERMAL_SHOK_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "The Thermal Shok bomb is used for capturing live humans, but it can also be used against most Alien races. It is fired from a Thermal Shok Launcher."
  STR_SONIC_PULSER_UFOPEDIA: "This device works in the same way as a standard issue grenade - except that it is many times more powerful. The grenade uses a single pulse sonic blast that is emitted in all directions simultaneously."
  STR_MC_READER_UFOPEDIA: "Inside the bodies of Aliens we have found small surgically implanted units. These are Control Implants designed by the Aquatoids to allow the constant supply of information from the battlefield, even at great distances. The Molecular Control Reader is an Alien communication device which is used to take information directly from M.C. Implants. RE/SYST units can use this device in combat to display an Alien's characteristics. Select the 'use' option. Then click on an Alien with the cursor."

  STR_ALIEN_PROBE_MISSION_UFOPEDIA: "The Alien Probe Mission is used for correlating data about the seabed, the resources, shipping and aeroplane flight paths of an area. The Alien subs involved in these missions are not a major threat in themselves, but they indicate sites of activity that may flare at any time."
  STR_ALIEN_INTERDICTION_UFOPEDIA: "The Aliens have a policy of policing areas they are interested in, sending out craft with the express purpose of securing an area before more intensive missions are begun. They will land at specific sites they intend to raid later to lock down the areas and prepare the way for the next level of activity."
  STR_ALIEN_RESOURCE_RAID_UFOPEDIA: "The sinking of ships and the downing of aircraft are key elements of the Alien strategy. The acquisition of materials is one of the prime Alien activities and as such is allied to these overtly aggressive acts. The Aliens also raid areas of geo-thermal activity, mining sites and sites of antiquity for minerals and refined metals and other human produced items."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "This can result in official contact between Aliens and corporations or governments at the highest level. The climax of this activity is characterized by intense Alien Sub activity in the waters of the organisation concerned. The Aliens will attempt to sign an agreement with a government or organisation by offering knowledge of their superior technologies. This Alien activity represents a major threat to RE/SYST. If a corporation or government co-operates with the invaders then its funding ceases."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens will construct secret undersea colonies in remote locations. After some initial reconnaissance flights some intense Alien Sub activity will occur as the colony is being built. These colonies are known to contain labs, cloning centres, surgical facilities for human and Alien experimentation. The presence of Alien colonies will generate more Alien activity without the presence of Alien Subs. In order to locate a colony an RE/SYST sub must patrol an area for a few hours to stand some chance of successful detection."
  STR_ALIEN_SURFACE_ATTACK_UFOPEDIA: "When the Aliens need humans they terrorize a port, attack an island, or raid a ship. Civilians will be directly threatened, to fulfil the perverse breeding needs of the Aliens and their hideous experiments."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If RE/SYST intercept subs are being particularly successful in sinking Alien craft then the Aliens may take some aggressive retaliatory action. This could result in a direct attack against an RE/SYST facility. However, the Aliens have to find an RE/SYST base in order to attack it, and provided Alien Subs are kept away then there should be little danger of an assault."
  STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once an Alien colony is constructed then it is re-supplied on a regular basis by a special supply ship. If one of these vessels is detected while touching down then it is certain that an Alien colony is nearby."

  STR_SURVEY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "This tiny submarine is used for reconnaissance and survey missions. It normally precedes larger vessels at the start of an Alien task force."
  STR_ESCORT_UFOPEDIA: "A medium sized escort vessel that is of little threat on its own. This craft precedes the arrival of larger vessels and increased activities."
  STR_CRUISER_UFOPEDIA: "The Cruiser is a general purpose craft, the mainstay of the Alien fleet, it is used in all types of Alien missions and is a dangerous adversary."
  STR_HEAVY_CRUISER_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy cruiser is a more powerful ship than the cruiser, larger weapons and propulsion systems boost its power. The Heavy Cruiser is used for resource missions to collect large quantities of minerals and equipment."
  STR_HUNTER_UFOPEDIA: "This vessel is equipped with an examination room for performing experiments and surgery on human subjects. The victims are subjected to the foulest tortures and the brain is often removed and stored for processing en-route."
  STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The battleship is the most aggressive ship the Aliens possess, it features all the Alien technologies and systems to act as a base of operations for any form of aggressive act the Aliens may want to perform, it carries a wide array of weapons."
  STR_DREADNOUGHT_UFOPEDIA: "The Dreadnought is a super troop carrier, fully equipped with all Alien technologies and a vast payload. The Dreadnought is a tough and formidable opponent."
  STR_FLEET_SUPPLY_CRUISER_UFOPEDIA: "The supply vessel is used during the construction of Alien colonies or for supplying existing colonies. It carries Alien nutrients, DNA, foetuses and other biological components."
