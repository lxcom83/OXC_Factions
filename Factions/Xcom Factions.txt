OXC-FACTIONS
by Luke83

WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?
Its a Mashup of UFO, TFTD and a few Crazy Ideas from the IDT :) It is inteneded as an alternate timeline telling an entirely NEW story. It is also intended to more of a non-liniar game with to allow a new experience each time you play BUT that may take some time to get it to work correctly so my only adivce is Pick your targets carefully.

WHY WAS IT MADE?
Mostly for myself, but its one of the first Hybrid Mods to be publically released so im sure another 10 will rise up shortly claiming i did it wrong but hey, who cares.

WHAT IS THIS MOD ABOUT?
An alternative dimension where the Aliens won the first War and took over the World.

Is the Mod finsihed?
NO, not even close, i expect it will be drawing close to completeion sometime in 2022 but it is playable.
