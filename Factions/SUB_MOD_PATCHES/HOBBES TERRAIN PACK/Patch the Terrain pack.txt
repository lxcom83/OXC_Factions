This is a quick hack to allow the Terrain Pack maps to add more Variety to OXC- Factions.

How to:
1) Download Hobbes Terrain pack from here:https://openxcom.mod.io/terrain-pack
2) Extract the Mod to the User/Mod/ folder as per normal.
3) Rename the Zip file from Factions\SUB_MOD_PATCHES\HOBBES TERRAIN PACK\V4.2-Terrain-Pack, from ".ZOP" to "Zip", this was manually changed to stop OXCE from reading this data if its not required. Now Extract as normal.
4) Manually override the files in Hobbes Terrain Pack with our new ones ( note, this will break it for any other mod so make sure you have a a backup)
5)Turn Mod ON in game and enjoy a Expanded Hybrid World :)
